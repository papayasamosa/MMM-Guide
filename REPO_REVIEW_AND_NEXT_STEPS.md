# Media-Mix-Lab: Current Repository State

This document is the concise repository-status summary for the current
checkout. It is intentionally separate from approved business requirements
and does not supersede `AGENTS.md`, `docs/approved_requirements/`, or
`docs/decision_log.md`.

## Repository baseline

Repository: `papayasamosa/Media-Mix-Lab`

Current `main` reviewed: `19fd12416cd882980bc83607f2f7677de38f4d48`

Current head: **UX Phase 6: whole-product QA and Search detail editor**
(merged PR #248, 2026-08-15).

The local Python distribution name remains `mmm-guide` for compatibility with
the existing install, script, export, and deployment surface. That legacy
distribution identifier is not the GitHub repository identity and is not
renamed by this status reconciliation.

## Delivered foundation

The current implementation includes:

- Streamlit workflow state, readiness guidance, technical pages, reporting,
  planning, project export, and project recovery.
- Immutable source versions and four logical source domains: Outcomes,
  Activity and Media, Context and External Factors, and optional Experiment
  Evidence.
- Standard workbook downloads for all four domains.
- Outcomes source-pack v2 parsing/adoption, governed outcome definitions and
  groups, draw-level grouped totals, DNA partition safeguards, and realistic
  synthetic templates.
- Explicit Family History New, DNA cross-sell, and Winback outcomes plus
  governed DNA outcomes.
- Governed activity definitions, identity-only `pooling_group_id`, ownership,
  model-input/spend/response-unit semantics, and cost mappings.
- Explicit Search-object governance separating demand, Paid Search spend and
  delivery, caps, organic/direct capture, and residual incrementality.
- Graph-authoritative direct, cross-product-halo, and excluded/diagnostic-only
  structures. Unsupported mediated, capacity-constrained, moderated, and
  residual-interaction engine structures fail closed.
- Joint hierarchical and market-specific partially pooled PyMC paths,
  outcome-scale counterfactual curves, draw-level totals, attribution,
  governed curve artefacts, and cost/FX-aware economics.
- Validation, approval, staleness, persistence, migration, resumability,
  scenario-planning, and optimisation contracts.
- Canonical native-weekly official preparation with an explicit governed
  calendar, an outer union of governed source periods, preserved missingness,
  and a fit-consumed-variable capability gate. Unsupported mixed-frequency
  inputs still fail closed because no executable conversion method is yet
  registered.
- Standard source-pack semantic adoption for Outcomes, Activity and Media,
  Context and External Factors, and optional Experiment Evidence, plus the
  current source-pack template/download and realistic synthetic-pack UX.
- Current graph-authoritative Causal Graph and Search-object governance UX,
  including direct, cross-product-halo, and excluded/diagnostic-only support
  with unsupported production graph roles still blocked.

## Known bounded gaps

These are implementation or decision boundaries, not permission to invent
business or modelling definitions:

- Executable mixed-frequency conversion remains the next governed data
  preparation work. The approved frequency-conversion registry is still
  empty, so monthly, quarterly, survey, and irregular inputs fail closed for
  official preparation unless already represented at a compatible native
  cadence.
- Ragged market-specific predictor mathematics (`FR-MOD-015`), production
  mediation, Search capacity/censoring mathematics, moderated pathways, and
  residual-interaction engine support remain decision-bound or unsupported.
- The full-core mypy debt ceiling is now 276 errors; it is a ceiling, not a
  target. CI must fail if the measured count increases.
- Scenario planning remains a steady-state monthly approximation rather than
  a sequential weekly simulation with starting adstock and terminal carryover.
- Chronos-2 or another future exogenous forecasting integration is not yet
  implemented.
- Real UK data readiness is an operational step and must be run only by an
  authorised analyst with approved local data outside Git.

## Required implementation discipline

Future substantive work must use the task-specific brief and repository
authority hierarchy, preserve the existing governance and mathematical
contracts, keep model-input units distinct from monetary spend, and record
engine capability boundaries honestly. No real Ancestry data belongs in this
repository, browser fixture, log, screenshot, or generated artefact.
